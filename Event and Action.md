# Event
Event is a signal from the app that something has happened. 
Here is a list of the most commonly used DOM events, just for reference:

## Mouse events:

+ `click` - occurs when an element is clicked with the left mouse button (on devices with touch screens, it occurs on touch).
+ `contextmenu` - occurs when an element is right-clicked.
+ `mouseover / mouseout` - when the mouse moves over / leaves the element.
+ `mousedown / mouseup` - when the mouse button was pressed / released on the element.
+ `mousemove` - when moving the mouse.
## Events on controls:

+ `submit` - The user has submitted the form <form>.
+ `focus` - The user focuses on the element, such as clicking on an <input>.
## Keyboard events:

+ `keydown and keyup` - when the user presses/releases a key.
## Document events:

`DOMContentLoaded` - When the HTML is loaded and rendered, the DOM of the document is fully built and available.
## CSS events:

`transitionend` - when the CSS animation is complete.

## Event handlers
An event can be assigned a handler, that is, a function that will work as soon as the event occurs.
